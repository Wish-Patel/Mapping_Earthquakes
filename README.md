# Mapping_Earthquakes
In this module we used Leaflet.js API to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake and tectonic plates data from a URL. 
Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

The end result is an interactive website where the user is able to see both the earthquake and tectonic plates data over 3 different map views (satellite view, street view and light view).
Below is a snippet of the final website:
